                <p>"Rafting down the rivers of Nahuel Huapi invites you to explore vast forests through its exciting,
                 action-packed rapids. During the summer, the flow increases, forming holes and waves that 
                 produce high-intensity rapids.

                Excursions are carried out on inflatable rafts that typically have a capacity for 10 people. 
                They are accompanied by a professional guide who provides necessary instructions to enjoy a 
                safe and fulfilling navigation experience."</p>
